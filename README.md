<p>The particular pattern in the way sunflower seeds grow aims to minimize, as much as possible, the amount of wasted space. And it has been discovered that this pattern is caused by a constant angle of rotation between the newest seed and the next one to be grown. What angle of rotation will achieve this? Incredibly, that angle is equal to &Phi; (~0.61803 or 1.6803), multiplied by 2&#120587; (aka a full turn). So, in the picture you see above, the angle between consecutive seeds is equal to &Phi; times a full turn. Incredible, right?</p>
<h2>Why &Phi is the best</h2>
<p>How come &Phi, also known as <i>the golden ratio</i>, multiplied by a full turn gives you the optimal pattern for the growth of sunflower seeds? What's wrong with 1/3 of a full turn, or 1/10 of a full turn, or &#120587; times a full turn? Well, let's put these other values to the test and it'll become clear to you.
